Our second big ride on the European continent. We heard about Denmark while in Iceland and we wanted to ride it. We started in Gothenburg Sweeden and rode south along the coast, crossing into Denmark just above Copenhagen. We took a ferry to the main part of Denmark and road north, then south along the western side. We crossed into Germany and then to the Netherlands.
