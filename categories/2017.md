Our first big ride. We started in Amsterdam and rode to the south east, cutting through a bit of Germany and going through Bastogne, where Natalie lived for a summer during her college years. We then rode to Paris and returned back to Amsterdam by riding west through Normandy and Dunkirk. It was our first major bike tour and we learned a lot.
