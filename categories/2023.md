Rode from Paris to Frankfurt via the south. One of the best parts of this trip was riding to Bitburg and spending time with Matt and Jessica and their family. The French pastries were amazing. We rode almost the entire trip on bike paths, which was a big contrast from Iceland where we spent the entire trip on the road.
