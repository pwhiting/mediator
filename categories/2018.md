We circumvented Iceland, riding counter-clockwise along highway 1. We had no idea how many beautiful waterfalls we'd see. We had mostly good weather and generally favorable wind. We were on roads with virtually no shoulder most of the way, which made this ride a little nerve racking. But our overwhelming memory is of the beauty of nature.
